# SENG 511 Class Notes

## Lecture 1

- Presentations will be shared after class
- Use the chat to ask questions, and we have 10 minutes Q&A at the end

Fallacies in SENG 511:

- Software project management is not needed - The team is self orgaizing. REBUTTAL: The project of larger size can't merely be organized by the the team.
- I have developed software in several projects - things were fine. REBUTTAL: The projects we're talking about here are bigger projects, industrial projects, and require new methods.
- The most important thing in a software project is the developer, not the manager. REBUTTAL: The success of the project is correlated with the software manager.
- Software project management just takes effort is not needed. REBUTTAL: A project manager requires other special expertise.
- There is no established knowledge of what is good software management. REBUTTAL: There is establishment of knowledge for software project management.
- I am applying agile methods and this agility solves the problem. REBUTTAL: We are need to learn which methods which are applicable in which situation.
- If there are problems in my project, I will easily know this and catch up later. REBUTTAL: You never catch up later and its hard to find problems in project without careful analysis.
- For the decisions to be made during the project, I can rely on my experience and my gut feeling. REBUTTAL: Its often that certain aspects are not explored sufficiently solely on subjective perspectives.
- I have learned project management in projects A and will apply the same knowledge for project B. REBUTTAL: Different projects are different and we sometimes need to adjust management styles towards different projects.
- I know what the customer wants and manage my project towards these perceived expefctations. I add some feature if I think it is good for the customer. REBUTTAL: Understanding customer needs is a challenge itself. Understanding new features like crazy without customer consultation could be a bad idea.
- Most important for project management is coding and technical skills. REBUTTAL: Not really, management is important.
- Planning for projects is waste of time. REBUTTAL: We need to scope everything in the beginning with milestones, etc.

For this class, there are 6 assignments (42%), final exam (33%), ten quizzes (20%), and participation (5%). Quizzes run within the lecture times. Participation is best evaluated through lab tutorial and attendance through those (small teams of like 30).

There is no coding in this class!

1. First lab prep to read a book chapter. It's called "Rethinking of software project success", the paper is uploaded to D2L.

## Lecture 2

The 4Ps in software engineering:

- People
- Project
- Process (enabling the project execution)
- Product (result of project)

When we compare a project and product manager, we think of the difference between "developing the right product", and developing the "product right". One is focused on process and the other is focused on the right goal.

The project manager identifies the project schedule, and monitors the project milestone and deliverables. They verify the quality of project deliverables.

THe product manager ensures that the customer requirements are met, and the vision of the product is fulfilled.

### Fundamentals of Project Management

- Project management is a set of tools, templates, and processes designed to answer the six questions:
- What business situation is being addressed?
- What do you need to do?
- What will you do?
- How will you do it?
- How will you know how to do it?
- How well did you do?

Projects fail due to the following reasons:

- Unrealistic goals
- Inaccurate estimates
- Bad system requirements
- Bad reporting of project status
- Unmanaged risks
- Poor communication between stakeholders
- Use of immature technology
- Inability to handle project complexity
- Sloppy development practices
- Stakeholder politics

54% of IT project failures can be attributed to project management.

### 4 Core Entities of Software Projects

- _Intent_: What is the project trying to achieve?
- _Product_: What is the outcome of the project?
- _Work_: How to build the target product?
- _People_: Who will be the available to perform the work?

Attributes:

- Time Quality and Risk
- Value
- Cost

### Organizational Factors of Software Projects

- Business domain
- Number of instances
- Maturity of organization
- Level of innovation
- Culture

Labs start next week. Two of them are Monday and two are Tuesday. You are assigned to one of the sections. The instructor will circulate the Zoom links for the labs.

## Lecture 3

The software development lifecycle is the following:

- Requirements analysis
- System Design
- Program Design
- Program Implementation
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Acceptance Testing
- Maintenance

### Code and Fix model

- Starts with informal product idea
- Develops code until a product is ready
- No order (plan) in place

There's no design, no specifications, the easiest way to develop software, but is also the most expensive way. The large scale industry software doesn't really work with this.

The V-model is what you follow to keep a project aligned to the original project description.

### Participation Grading

- Self-assessment
- Per student, we highly recommend a spreadsheet with three columns
  - Lab date, performance, and comment
- The sheet will be shared with the instructors at the end of the month

### Definition of software project management life cycle

- Scoping - Where you want to understand what your clients and what they want. We learn how to find how to describe this to our developers later on. This isn't necessarily easy, because the client might have trouble articulating their thoughts into a technical aspect, and maybe we're unable to properly understand the client. When scoping out the project, we need to adjust our requirements to satisfy all the constraints.
  - Almost two thirds of all features are never used. This implies wasted development effort, increased maintenance effort, customers overwhelmed from user features. This relates to overscoping as this wastes a lot of time and effort.
  - A requirement is a desired end state whose successful integration into a solution meets one or more needs and delivers a specific, measurable, and incremental business value to the org.
  - Functional requirements is something that is directly functional to the user, and non-functional requirements are pertaining to the quality of the software.
- Launching
- Monitoring & controlling
- Closing

### MVP (minimum value product)

Oftentimes its hard to outline the core part of the software. The MVP idea came out in 2008 with the intention with a kernel of functionality to describe to the user what the product is all about.

It is minimal in the sense that without the MVP, the product doesn't make sense.

The main purposes of the MVP:

- To allow the product to be deployed
- To target market opportunities
- To create viable product for the customer
- To test the fundamental business hypothesis
- To test the product in the market
- To get customer feedback
- To identify the most viable features by iteratively testing the product

The first quiz is happening the _next Wednesday_. It happens at the later.

## Lecture 4

There are five functions for Software Project Management (SPM).

- Planning
- Organizing
- Staffing
- Directing
- Controlling

Planning reduces uncertainty. It also increases understanding and efficiency (prevent mistakes when the project is actually running). Planning is more important than the plan. In this case, the plan is the result of the planning. The planning is more important because it is the same process and guides us in the whole process.

Here are the following things to plan in a project:

1. Effort -> Effort Estimation (pricing reflection is accurate, and how much effort is required)
2. Time/Duration -> Time Management (Effort is measured in person months, person years)
3. Scheduling -> Time Management (Determine which activities are done in what sequence)
4. Resource -> Human resource management (Effort required to allocate resources to perform activities)
5. Functionality/scope -> Product (release) planning (Plan the functionality of our product and the slices of the software offered in releases)
6. Quality -> Quality management (planning for quality)
7. Risks -> Risks management
8. Stakholders involved -> Stakeholder management (Stakeholders include contractors, managers, clients. The stakeholder management is planning is because their early involvement to help build the _right_ product)
9. Integration -> Integration management (We need to figure out how services from different teams are integrated)
10. Procurement -> Procurement management (We need to learn things on how to manage procurement. Procurement in this context is buying 3rd party goods)

Nine Deadly Sins of Project Planning:

1. Not planning at all
2. Failing to account for all project activities
3. Failure to plan for risk
4. Using the same plan for every project
5. Applying pre-packaged plans indiscriminately
6. Allowing a plan to diverge from project reality
7. Planning in too much detail too soon (There's point plan for activities way down the road, we're wasting resources on something that could change)
8. Planning to catch up later
9. Not learning from past planning sins

"SMART" Rule of Planning

- Specific - Plan is detailed and gives stakeholders a good idea of how things will proceed
- Measurable - We can quantify results
- Acceptable - The stakeholders agree with the plan
- Realistic - Realistic with achivements
- Time based - Deadlines are set

## Lecture 5

Work Breakdown Structure - WBS

### WBS Completion Criteria

- Status and completion is measurable
- The activity is bounded
- The activity has a deliverable
- Time and cost can be estimated
- Activity duration is within acceptable limits
- Work assignments are independent

Course projects were discussed next. We start on that on Monday.

### Prioritization

There are different ways to do prioritization. This is essentially a way of classifying things based on their priority. Specifically, it is the activity of arranging items or activities in order of importance relative to each other.

Prioritization of features, tasks, processes, defects, resources, modules, and requirements.

This is a multi-criteria decision. Sample criteria:

- Value
- Risk
- Cost
- Benefit
- Difficult
- Volatile
- Satisfaction
- Dissatisfaction

Prioritization results will be different for each criteria. Also, depending on the defect level, some defects should be prioritized on top of others.

Another prioritization would be if the user thinks a certain bug is really important even though it is not necessarily important in other contexts.

Stakeholders:

- Customers
- Quality Assurance
- Competitors
- Board of Directors
- Management

Classify items by priority. The more severe ones are completed first. You create a scale to categorize the importance of each category.

#### Functional Approach

If we have several alternatives, we need to normalize all of the alternatives to make them comparable.

To reflect importance, each criterion is associated with a weight w.

An aggregation is used to obtain the global evaluation of the alternative. This is basically called weighted average computations.

Disadvantages: Weightings are pretty arbitrary.

#### Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)

#### Kano Method

The first quiz is happening the _next Wednesday_. It happens at the later time in the lecture.

## Lecture 6

### Prioritization

As a review, in the functional approach, all criteria must be normalized to make them comparable. Each criterion is associated with a weight w, and we computed the weighted average.

When reflecting on the functional approach, the aggregation procedure is simple and the obtained result is very strong.

The problem with this approach is that it strongly assumes that the compensation and compromise among criteria is perfect.

#### AHP

Used widely in software projects and beyond. An analytical and hierarchical process.

- Decompose the goal into a hierarchy of criteria or sub-criteria.
- Pair-wise comprsion matrix is used to determine relative weights of criteria, sub-criteria as well as the evaluations of alternatives.
- Weights are not arbitrarily assigned
- A linear additive function is used to compute an overall score for each alternative using the evaluations and relative weights in the previous step.

The goal is on the top, the criteria is on the next level, sub-criteria on the third level, and alternatives on the last level.

Using eigenvalues, weightings are (somehow) calculated.

Weight 0 is the weights on the stakeholder levels.
Weight 1, 2, 3 represent the importance of alternatives. R1 to R3 is alternatives and S1 and S3 are stakeholders.

Assignment 1 due September 26th.
Assignment 2 is due October 5th.
Assignment 3 is due October 17th.
Assignment 4 is due October 28th.
Assignment 5 is due November 19th.
Assignment 6 is due December 1st.

You can expect true/false questions on the quiz, no computations.

## Lecture 7

In the beginning, we did a quick review on AHP.

The strength of AHP we do pairwise comparison for better results.

M0 is the comparison between the goal and the stakeholders. How important is each stakeholder.

M1 is the comparison between stakeholder 1 and all the requirements.

To compute global priorities, we do matrix multiplication is taking the results of the pairwise comparisons of the stakeholder groups and multiple by a matrix all the values of the requirements.

### Kano Method

Kano was the inventor of the method.

A means of analyzing customer desires. As the customer satisfaction doesn'
t necessarily mean that the requirements are met.

Categories of Kano Method:

- Must be (M): Delivering thes features does not affect the satisfaction but not doing it will cause disatisfaction
- One dimensional (O): Fulfillment of feature means customer satisfaction
- Attractive (A): Not explicitly requested by user
- Indifference (I): Customer is indifferent towards the feature
- Reverse (R): User does not want this feature
- Questionable (Q): Features are not considered in analysis

## Lecture 8

He went over the quiz today.

### Kano Method

In this case, we must evaluate both the functional and dysfunctional reactions from the user. If the user gets it, do they like it? If the user doesn't have it, how do they react? That determines the kano method category.

The true focus here is the asymmetry. Just cause someone is satisfied with something doesn't mean they are unsatisfied without it.

This is the end of prioritization.

### Planning Releases for Incremental Development

As people make change requests, we should look at features that are never used. Functionality doesn't need to always grow.

When looking at the feature and change requests, the feature requests is generally always higher than the change requested. As change requests goes up, the feature requests go up.

WHen making design decisions, we need to balance time/cost with quality

### Features

A feature is a set of logically related requirements that provides a capability to the user and enables the satisfaction of business objectives.

There's different ways to define features:

- State
- ID
- Submitter
- Company
- Domain
- Description
- Contract
- Priorities
- Motivation

## Lecture 9

Release planning is important but release planning is complicated.

### Feature Dependencies

Feature dependency create additional complexity. Ignoring them makes the plan you're creating missing the actual needs.

1. Coupling - when two features are really coupled
2. When you should only have one or the other
3. You have only at most one of a feature type
4. You have at least one of a feature type
5. Weak precedence - When one feature precedes another in terms of priority/prerequisites
6. Strict precedence - Must be released together
7. Value dependency - The value of the release is the sum of the value of features
8. Effort dependency - he value of the release is the sum of the value of the features

### Stakeholder Feature Points

A way to measure total stakeholder satisfaction.

On the quiz, no calculations.

## Lecture 10

A good release plan which provides most prioritized features with the lowest effort.

### Resource Constraints

A resource type r belongs to class 1 if the feature related consumption of the resource is limited to exactly the release in which the feature is offered. Resources of this class are called local based on its spending mode.

The workflow for release planning:

- Feature elicitation
- Problem specification
- Resource estimation
- Stakeholder voting
- Release plan generation
- Evaluation of plan alternatives
- Plan implementation

### The diversification principle

A single solution to a cognitive complex problem is less likely to reflect the actual problem when compared to a

Need to get back to this, got distracted with some other stuff during the lecture.

## Lecture 11

Capacities is the in-person hours. Releases have a duration and the option to assign resources to it.

Release resource capacity should be the total person hours for the duration of the release.

For defining the capacities: The resource utilization factor should be above 100% for all resources.

### Comphrensiveness of Release Decisions

- Which features should be offered in the next release(s) and why?
- Which feature shouldn't be offered in the next release?
- What's the best time for product release and why?
- New features versus fixing bugs/improvements?
- How to adjust to change for a given release?

## Lecture 12

Didn't have time to concentrate as I had some other logistical things to handle. He was talking about critical paths.

Critical path is the shortest amount of time it takes to complete a project.

## Lecture 13

Using past experience or knowledge of an experienced team member, estimate different projects.

What are the causes of variation in duration:

- Varying skill levels
- Unexpected events
- Efficiency of work time
- Mistakes and misunderstandings
- Variation of capability of the system
- Common cause variation

Methods for estimating task duration:

- Extrapolating based on similarity to other activities
- Studying historical data
- Seeking expert advice
- Applying the Delphi technique
- Applying the three point technique
