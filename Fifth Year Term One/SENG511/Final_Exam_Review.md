# Final Exam Review

## Lecture 2

A project manager identifies project tasks and builds a work breakdown structure. They develop the project schedule and coordinate activities of team members and sub teams.

On the other hand, product manager is more on developing the project. This includes gathering and prioritizing product/customer requirements. Additionally, defining the product vision & working closely with engineering is a part of it.

A lot of projects fail because of poor project management. This includes bad planning and insufficient communication, ineffective management, and failure to follow proper methodologies.

There are four core entities of software projects:

- Intent - What is the project trying to achieve?
- Product - What is the outcome of the project?
- Work - How to build the targeted product?
- People - Who is available to perform that work?

Here are some types of lifecycle models:

1. Code and fix - Starts with an informal general product idea. You develop code until the product is ready, but no really order/plan in place.
2. V-Model - More similar to waterfall methodology.

## Lecture 3

There are different ways to classify software development.

They can be highly predictive in the way as follows:

- Requirements are specified during initiation and planning
- Risk and cost are controlled by detailed planning based on an in-depth analysis of requirements and constraints prior to development
- Key stakeholders are involved at scheduled milestones

They can also be highly adaptive:

- Requirements are elaborated at frequent intervals during software development
- Risk and cost controlled as requirements and constraints emerge
- Key stakeholders are continuously involved

Project management life cycle is a sequence of processes that includes the following:

- Scoping
- Planning
- Launching
- Monitoring and Controlling
- Closing

Oftentimes, what the client want is not necessarily what the client needs.

There's also the idea of the "imbalance of functionality usage", known as the pareto-principle. Almost two thirds of all features are almost never used. This implies

- Wasted development effort
- Increased maintenance effort
- Customers overwhelmed from user features

What are requirements?

A requirement is a desired end-state whose successful integration into the solution meets one or more needs and delivers specific, measurable, and incremental business value to the organization.
There are functional requirements and non-functional requirements (quality) requirements.

The following are the purposes of having a Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

- To allow the product to be deployed
- To target market opportunities
- To create a viable product for the customer
- To test the fundamental business hypothesis
- To meet needs of early adopters
- To gather feedback
- To accelerate sales to first customers

## Lecture 4

There are five functions of SPM (Software Project Management):

1. Planning - Establish future course of action at all levels of the organization
2. Organizing - Structure efforts that involve collaboration and communication
3. Staffing - Acquire, develop, and retain staff resources
4. Directing - Energize, motivate, and guide staff
5. Controlling - Activities conducted to determine whether or not progress is made according to the plan

There are several things to plan in a project.

1. Effort -> Effort Estimation
2. Time/Duration -> Time Management
3. Schedule -> Time Management
4. Resources -> Human Resource Management
5. Functionality/scope -> Product (release) planning
6. Quality -> Quality Management
7. Risks -> Risk management

There are several reasons why planning is so important.

- Planning reduces uncertainty
- Planning increases understanding
- Planning improves efficiency
- Planning is more important than the plan

What is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)? The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical description of all of the work that must be done to meet the needs of the client.

Here are some WBS completion criteria:

- Status and completion are measurable
- The activity is bounded
- The activity has a deliverable
- Time and cost can be estimated
- Activity duration is within acceptable limits
- Work assignments are independent

## Lecture 5

- Prioritization is an activity that rearranges items or activities in order of importance relative to each other.
- Prioritization of features, tasks, processes, defects, resources, modules, requirements.
- Feature prioritization: Selection and ranking of most valuable features from a set of candidates
- Multi-criteria decision-making. Sample criteria as below:
  - Value
  - Risk
  - Cost
  - Benefit
  - Difficulty
  - Volatility
  - Satisfaction
  - Dissatisfaction

There are several prioritization methods.

- Functional Approach
- AHP
- Kano Method
