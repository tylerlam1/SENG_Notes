# Final Exam Review

## Lecture 2

A project manager identifies project tasks and builds a work breakdown structure. They develop the project schedule and coordinate activities of team members and sub teams.

On the other hand, product manager is more on developing the project. This includes gathering and prioritizing product/customer requirements. Additionally, defining the product vision & working closely with engineering is a part of it.

A lot of projects fail because of poor project management. This includes bad planning and insufficient communication, ineffective management, and failure to follow proper methodologies.

There are four core entities of software projects:

- Intent - What is the project trying to achieve?
- Product - What is the outcome of the project?
- Work - How to build the targeted product?
- People - Who is available to perform that work?

Here are some types of lifecycle models:

1. Code and fix - Starts with an informal general product idea. You develop code until the product is ready, but no really order/plan in place.
2. V-Model - More similar to waterfall methodology.
