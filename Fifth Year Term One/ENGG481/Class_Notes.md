The first module is about human civilization.

65 million years ago, we have evidence of life on earth. Humans didn't come until 4 million years ago.

- Early humans were nomad hunter-gatherers: takers.
- Then they became settlers and began to raise animals and plant food.

For the past 6000 years, we started building cities:

- Middle humans built cities, pyramids, and palaces.
- Humans exploited minerals and metals, and technology.

In the last 2000 years:

- We have had massive advances in the last 1000 years. We have airplanes and smartphones now.
- Late humans over exploit resources, with the "West" owning most of the products and wealth

## Lecture 5

Today we're talking about the social revolution.

Social revolution is the idea that revolutionary political cannot occur without radical changes in society and culture.

Social revolution drives the elimination of social institution that are inherently coercive and authoritiarian (like traditional family, heterosexuality, or limiting access to education). Traditional family means mom and dad only. Now you live with whoever you love.

Social revolutions are sudden changes in the structure and nature in society. These revolutions are recognized as having transformed also:

- Economy
- Culture
- Philosophy - The study of thought. How people think. The example given was that in some times/places, kids can wander around the city alone.
- Politics - Politics changes all time

Examples:

- Women's liberation
- Gay liberation

New ideas include universal education, the rights of youth and women, abolishment of labour division, and gay liberation.

The Canadian Bill of Rights states: 1) It is hereby recognized and declared that in Cnada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination.
