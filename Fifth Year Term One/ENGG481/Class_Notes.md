The first module is about human civilization.

65 million years ago, we have evidence of life on earth. Humans didn't come until 4 million years ago.

- Early humans were nomad hunter-gatherers: takers.
- Then they became settlers and began to raise animals and plant food.

For the past 6000 years, we started building cities:

- Middle humans built cities, pyramids, and palaces.
- Humans exploited minerals and metals, and technology.

In the last 2000 years:

- We have had massive advances in the last 1000 years. We have airplanes and smartphones now.
- Late humans over exploit resources, with the "West" owning most of the products and wealth
