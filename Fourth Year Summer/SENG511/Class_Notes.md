Fallacies in SENG 511:

- Software project management is not needed - The team is self orgaizing. REBUTTAL: The project of larger size can't merely be organized by the the team.
- I have developed software in several projects - things were fine. REBUTTAL: The projects we're talking about here are bigger projects, industrial projects, and require new methods.
- The most important thing in a software project is the developer, not the manager. REBUTTAL: The success of the project is correlated with the software manager.
- Software project management just takes effort is not needed. REBUTTAL: A project manager requires other special expertise.
- There is no established knowledge of what is good software management. REBUTTAL: There is establishment of knowledge for software project management.
- I am applying agile methods and this agility solves the problem. REBUTTAL: We are need to learn which methods which are applicable in which situation.
- If there are problems in my project, I will easily know this and catch up later. REBUTTAL: You never catch up later and its hard to find problems in project without careful analysis.
- For the decisions to be made during the project, I can rely on my experience and my gut feeling. REBUTTAL: Its often that certain aspects are not explored sufficiently solely on subjective perspectives.
- I have learned project management in projects A and will apply the same knowledge for project B. REBUTTAL: Different projects are different and we sometimes need to adjust management styles towards different projects.
- I know what the customer wants and manage my project towards these perceived expefctations. I add some feature if I think it is good for the customer. REBUTTAL: Understanding customer needs is a challenge itself. Understanding new features like crazy without customer consultation could be a bad idea.
- Most important for project management is coding and technical skills. REBUTTAL: Not really, management is important.
- Planning for projects is waste of time. REBUTTAL: We need to scope everything in the beginning with milestones, etc.

For this class, there are 6 assignments (42%), final exam (33%), ten quizzes (20%), and participation (5%). Quizzes run within the lecture times. Participation is best evaluated through lab tutorial and attendance through those (small teams of like 30).

There is no coding in this class!

1. First lab prep to read a book chapter. It's called "Rethinking of software project success", the paper is uploaded to D2L.
