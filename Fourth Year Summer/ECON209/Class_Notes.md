# ECON 209

## Lecture 1

Knowing about the money aspect of things are very important. Sometimes its up to the engineer to determine the costs of things.

Our instructor has background in engineering sales and learned quite a bit about the money aspect in engineering. He's also had experience with consulting and project evaluations.

In this class, we look at different economic concepts for the first couple of weeks. Next, we focus on practical problems like whether a company should invest in a project. We look at inflation, taxes. etc. The first couple weeks will be similar to ECON201/203.

We don't need the textbook for the first couple of weeks. If you do though, he recommends _Macro-Economics_ text. The official textbook for the course is _Contemporary Engineering Economics_. We don't need the textbook if we don't want it.

First Quiz has been moved to Monday July 12th. Midterm is July 21st. Second quix is August 4th. On the quiz, usually not more than 20 questions. Probably around 20 minutes for that.

The best way to prepare for the quizzes is coming to lectures, working through worksheets, and going to the tutorials.

The tutorials starts next week. In the tutorial, the TAs will go through the questions. The tutorial answer key will not be added to D2L (but the questions will be on D2L). This is incentive to go to the tutorials. The tutorial themselves are not recorded.

The Department of Economics added a curving scale. Also there's room to push weight to the final if you do better on the final than on the midterm.

Now we'll get into the actual material.

Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated among alternative uses to satisfy human wants and needs. It's a study of choice. An economy is a set of interrelated consumption and production activities to maintain a standard of living.

- Resources: Land (minerals, timber, metals, etc), labour (intelligence and human work, called sweat equality), and capital (goods used to make other goods, uses resources to build a building).
- Scarcity: There is not enough goods and services to meet everyone's needs and desires.
- Opportunity cost: What is given up when a choice or decision is made, including the most valued alternative

There are three key economic ideas:

- People are rational. We have the ability to reason, and gather all relevant information. They should be able to determine if the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost.
- People Respond to Incentives. This could include money, food, finding a mate, or protecting their young.
- People make decisions on the margin.

Here are examples of irrational behavior:

- Measuring costs and benefits as proportions rather than absolute value (i.e. Thinking that $25 off on a $1000 item is worth less than $25 off a $100 item)
- Failure to ignore sunk costs (You should ignore money you've already lost)
- Paying too much tax in order to get a big tax return. i.e. Thinking that winnings in a Casino are worth less than "normal" money
- People are prone to mental accounting (spending your money recklessly after winning a lottery)
- Jumping into a stock market because a neighbour recommended a stock

Key Economic Question a society faces:

1. What goods and services will be produced by society? Think about what people want.
2. How will the goods and services be produced?
3. Who will receive the goods and services produced?

Market Failure - when the society fail to provide these services (like health care, firefighters) so the government provides them.

The solution to the three economic problems described above depends on the economic system. For example, a right wing economy would have more privatized businesses. The left wing economies have more government-centralized services.

Karl Marx is the founder of communism (command economy). He felt that capitalism cause unemployments (from the depressions). There were no "social nets" that creates huge amounts of unemployments.

Adam Smith wrote _The Wealth of Nations_ in 1776 that talked about capitalism and the free market. The idea is that the government would not interfere in the market. He said an "Invisible Hand" would guide the demand and production in the market. He said that for a free market system to work, you need to have a property rights system and a court system to enforce it (ie. Someone to ensure that you own something).

## Lecture 2

Today we're going to talk about economic models, micro/macro economics, GDP, business cycles, as well as inflation. First couple minutes the instructor gave a brief overview of the previous lecture.

In terms of the textbook, we're skipping a couple lectures. We skipped chapters 2 and 3, and going straight from chapter 1 to chapter 4. The quiz has 24 hour access for all students in the class.

- Economic Model - Tries to predict human behavior. We try to develop a model to predict when something changes. The most important model in microeconomics is supply/demand. Supply and demand is a human behaviour model because it tries to predict human behavior.
- Scientific Method - Includes testable hypothesis. This is a casuable observation of the real world. For example, we can hypothesize that the demand for video games increases when the price goes down. Gather the data to prove it, and analyze the data. Once the data has been analyzed, we can either reject or prove our hypothesis. In economics, its a bit more difficult to get data. We have to observe human behaviour, which is a bit harder.

Specific Steps:

1. Step 1 - Testable Hypothesis
2. Step 2 - Decide on the variables and assumptions on the model
3. Step 3 - Gather the data (Questionaire and surveys)
4. Step 4 - Analyze the data
5. Step 5 - Either reject or accept the hypothesis

This is the end of Chapter 1.

Microeconomics looks at specific industries (What we purchase), etc. Macroeconomics looks at broader issues like employment, economic growth, etc. As the name suggests, micro looks like smaller markets and macro looks at bigger issues.

- Gross Domestic Product - The final market value of all goods and values produced within a economy over a certain period. All nations in the UN have to report a GDP. In Canada 2018 was 2.242 trillion (CAD) dollars. The US reported in 2017 was 19.5 trillion USD. The expenditure is equal to the income. The final market value means the final price of the product.

When GDP is measured, four main sectors are analyzed.

1. Consumption by Household - When you go buy appliances, food, services (haircut).
2. Gross Investment by Business/Firms - When companies goes out and buys machinery, construction, and changes in inventories.
3. Government Spending - Gov't spending on final goods, investment goods, and all purchases of resources. Does not include transfer payments, because no production took place.
4. International Spending - We do exports minus imports. This is because imports do not have production happening in the nation.

GDP doesn't measure the distribution of wealth, happiness, pollution, general wisdom. The point that is being put across is that while it measures the general standard of living, it does not measure everything. It does not measure the value of used goods.

In nominal GDP, it doesn't keep track of inflation. In real GDP, we want to take into account inflation to get the "real" GDP. Real GDP uses 2007 prices.

- A deflator is an index that measures the change of prices over time. An example is the consumer price index (CRI). Another GDP deflator is another.

The relationship between real GDP and nominal GDP is:
- Real GDP = Nominal GDP / Deflator \* 100

### Definitions
- Potential GDP - A trend line which GDP converges to
- Inflationary Gap - The actual GDP is greater than the potential GDP
- Expansionary Phase - Where real GDP is rising. It gets to the peak. We knows that economics never continue to peak only. It goes down too, which leads to the up and down cycles. Strikes are signs of recessionary phases (the downward slope). The trough is where unemployment is high, and firms just want to increase their sales.
- Recessionary Gap - The real GDP is less than potential GDP
- A recession is when real GDP is falls for two consecutive quarters. This is the official decision for recession.
- A depression is when real GDP falls for two years or more.

If the economy is at the potential GDP, there is no expansionary phase or recessionary phase.

- Inflation - Over these past couple years, Canada has little inflation (around 2% each year). A inflation is a rise in the general price level. The general price level is measured by the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation is influenced by the general price costs, rather than the price of a specific item.
1. Inflation diminished the purchasing power of the dollar over time. Idea - the dollar can't buy as much as it did before, so it is worth less.
2. Distribution of income effect. Some people who make money on a fixed income (contractors) are disadvantaged. On the contrary, landlords can adjust their prices based on inflation.
3. Can hurt foreign trade.
4. Menu costs - Cost of changing prices. It costs companies money to change their prices (book conferences to deliberate these prices).
5. Bracket Creep - If our salaries are increased due to inflation, we are taxed more so we actually lose money. Taxes tiers always are behind in terms of inflation.

## Lecture 3

Quiz Information:
- Starts 9PM Monday
- Closes 9PM Tuesday
- 20 MC in 30 minutes
- Includes all material up until today
- Open book
- Cannot revisit previously answered question
- Non-stress quiz :) 
- Can use calculators

- Cost Push - Inflation as a result as input prices rising (like oil)
- Demand Pull - Upward pressure on prices that follows a shortage in supply.
- Printing of money - Affects cost push and command pull

- Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Measures the price of a typical basket of typical household items. Measured per month (around 600 goods). The value is the rate of change that measures inflation in the company. People who come up with this value visit department stores and checks the prices of these goods. Also includes imports.
    - Typical household items include food, transportation, health, shelter, education, household operations, clothing.
- GDP Deflator - Measures much more household items but does not measure imports.

### Limitations of CPI
- Substitution Bias - Assumes that consumers will not change the things they buy based on the price of the item
- May not represent all consumers. For example, baby diapers is apart of their basket. iPhones and new products are not usually considered.
- Weights of different consumer items in the basket are only changed periodically
- Quality Bias - Does not take into account the improved quality of a product that may cause a increase in price
- Outlet Bias - Many people buy from large discount stores (Costco, Walmart) and the CPI doesn't take this into account. CPI doesn't go to major outlets. They go to like Safeway, etc.

- Core CPI - Take things out of the CPI basket (take out taxes, food, and energy).

CPI = Market Basket Expenditure in Specific Year / Market Basket Expenditure in Base Year * 100

Real GDP = Nominal / Index * 100

2007 was chosen as the base year because that year the economy was relatively stable.

- Inflation Rate: (Current Year CPI - Base Year CPI) / Base Year CPI * 100

- Real Growth Rate: (Current Year Real GDP - Base Year Real GDP) / Base Year Real GDP * 100. Base Year GDP doesn't necessarily need to be 2007, could just be the first year you want to compare with.

### Unemployment
To get the unemployment rate here in Canada, Labour Stats Canada contacts around 100,000 people in Canada with the survey.

In order for someone to be classified as unemployed, they have to 1. Be not working 2. Actively looking for a job 3. Ready to go back to work immediately.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE = (# of people unemployed) / (labour force) * 100

LABOUR FORCE = unemployed + employed

- Working Age Population - People 15 years of age and older who are legally entitled to work in Canada
- Not in labour force - Retired people who are not working, people in prison/nursing homes/hospital, full time students, Stay at home parents, discouraged workers. If a retired person is working, they would be classified as employed.

PARTICIPATION RATE = (Labour Force / Working Age Population) * 100

- Natural Rate of Unemployment - The unemployment rate of a economy in the long run (in Canada, about 6-7%). There will always be able to quit to look for better positions, new graduates who are unemployed for a period of time, etc. 

Three Types of Unemployment:
- Frictional Unemployment - Where people are quitting a job to find a better job.
- Seasonal Unemployment - Related to jobs that are only available in certain seasons (ski hill, etc)
- Cyclical Unemployment - Unemployment due to downturn in economy
- Structural Unemployment - Unemployment due to technological change, so they are displaced. Or there is a demise of that industry. Another example is if a gov't enforces a minimum wage that increases unemployment. This is a very problematic type of unemployment.

If we didn't have money, we would need a barter system. A barter system is a trade of goods for goods. Barter system is difficult because you need to find system who needs your exact goods.

Number of possible Prices = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of goods you have. Especially when you have a large number of goods, there's so many different types of trades that can happen.

Money eliminates the issue described above.

### Functions of Money
1. Medium of Exchange

The medium of exchange must be accepted by all parties.

2. Unit of Account

It must have unit, as Canadian dollars has quarters, wages, etc. It must be divisible without the loss of value. If you are charged $20, if you pay two $10 bills then there is no loss of value.

3. Store of Value

It must have some sort of value. Same if you have a computer, it has a store of value. Stocks have a store of value. Money is definitely the most liquid of these assets, where it can be transferred really easy.

All money is subject to Gresham's Law. The idea is that bad money drives out good money. In other words, counterfeit money drives out the usability of good/real money.

- Token Coin - The metal content less more than the face value of the coin. If it was worth more, people will melt the coin.
- Fiat Money - Money with no intrinsic value. For example bills are Fiat Money because its literally just a piece of plastic with no real use other than money.

### Fractional Banks
This is a system where banks only hold a portion of the money deposited with them as reserves (around 4% in Canada). The rest of the money is used for loans.

- The money that is held is in a vault or deposit in the Bank of Canada.
- Gov't makes most of their money from loans.
- Banks are highly profitable.
- They hold deposits and assets.
- They honour cheques.
- They contribute clearing acitivites from the databank. The computerized clearing system is measured by the Canadian Payments Association (CPA). This is important when you transfer your money from one bank to another.

### Money Creation

Assumptions:
- Bank desired reserve ratio is 10%
- The bank lends out all its excess reserves
- A $1000 is deposited into bank A
- Total Reserve = Desired Reserves + Excess Services

Change in Total Deposits = 1 / dr * Change in Ro

dr = desired reserve ratio
Ro = Initial Reserve

Note: If the person depositing decides to keep some money to spend, thats a cash drain. That decreases the money multiplier. THe money multiplier becomes 1 / (dr + cr), which is the percentage they keep.
