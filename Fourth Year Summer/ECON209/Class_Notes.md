# ECON 209

## Lecture 1

Knowing about the money aspect of things are very important. Sometimes its up to the engineer to determine the costs of things.

Our instructor has background in engineering sales and learned quite a bit about the money aspect in engineering. He's also had experience with consulting and project evaluations.

In this class, we look at different economic concepts for the first couple of weeks. Next, we focus on practical problems like whether a company should invest in a project. We look at inflation, taxes. etc. The first couple weeks will be similar to ECON201/203.

We don't need the textbook for the first couple of weeks. If you do though, he recommends _Macro-Economics_ text. The official textbook for the course is _Contemporary Engineering Economics_. We don't need the textbook if we don't want it.

First Quiz has been moved to Monday July 12th. Midterm is July 21st. Second quix is August 4th. On the quiz, usually not more than 20 questions. Probably around 20 minutes for that.

The best way to prepare for the quizzes is coming to lectures, working through worksheets, and going to the tutorials.

The tutorials starts next week. In the tutorial, the TAs will go through the questions. The tutorial answer key will not be added to D2L (but the questions will be on D2L). This is incentive to go to the tutorials. The tutorial themselves are not recorded.

The Department of Economics added a curving scale. Also there's room to push weight to the final if you do better on the final than on the midterm.

Now we'll get into the actual material.

Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated among alternative uses to satisfy human wants and needs. It's a study of choice. An economy is a set of interrelated consumption and production activities to maintain a standard of living.

- Resources: Land (minerals, timber, metals, etc), labour (intelligence and human work, called sweat equality), and capital (goods used to make other goods, uses resources to build a building).
- Scarcity: There is not enough goods and services to meet everyone's needs and desires.
- Opportunity cost: What is given up when a choice or decision is made, including the most valued alternative

There are three key economic ideas:

- People are rational. We have the ability to reason, and gather all relevant information. They should be able to determine if the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost.
- People Respond to Incentives. This could include money, food, finding a mate, or protecting their young.
- People make decisions on the margin.

Here are examples of irrational behavior:

- Measuring costs and benefits as proportions rather than absolute value (i.e. Thinking that $25 off on a $1000 item is worth less than $25 off a $100 item)
- Failure to ignore sunk costs (You should ignore money you've already lost)
- Paying too much tax in order to get a big tax return. i.e. Thinking that winnings in a Casino are worth less than "normal" money
- People are prone to mental accounting (spending your money recklessly after winning a lottery)
- Jumping into a stock market because a neighbour recommended a stock

Key Economic Question a society faces:

1. What goods and services will be produced by society? Think about what people want.
2. How will the goods and services be produced?
3. Who will receive the goods and services produced?

Market Failure - when the society fail to provide these services (like health care, firefighters) so the government provides them.

The solution to the three economic problems described above depends on the economic system. For example, a right wing economy would have more privatized businesses. The left wing economies have more government-centralized services.

Karl Marx is the founder of communism (command economy). He felt that capitalism cause unemployments (from the depressions). There were no "social nets" that creates huge amounts of unemployments.

Adam Smith wrote _The Wealth of Nations_ in 1776 that talked about capitalism and the free market. The idea is that the government would not interfere in the market. He said an "Invisible Hand" would guide the demand and production in the market. He said that for a free market system to work, you need to have a property rights system and a court system to enforce it (ie. Someone to ensure that you own something).

## Lecture 2

Today we're going to talk about economic models, micro/macro economics, GDP, business cycles, as well as inflation. First couple minutes the instructor gave a brief overview of the previous lecture.

In terms of the textbook, we're skipping a couple lectures. We skipped chapters 2 and 3, and going straight from chapter 1 to chapter 4. The quiz has 24 hour access for all students in the class.

- Economic Model - Tries to predict human behavior. We try to develop a model to predict when something changes. The most important model in microeconomics is supply/demand. Supply and demand is a human behaviour model because it tries to predict human behavior.
- Scientific Method - Includes testable hypothesis. This is a casuable observation of the real world. For example, we can hypothesize that the demand for video games increases when the price goes down. Gather the data to prove it, and analyze the data. Once the data has been analyzed, we can either reject or prove our hypothesis. In economics, its a bit more difficult to get data. We have to observe human behaviour, which is a bit harder.

Specific Steps:

1. Step 1 - Testable Hypothesis
2. Step 2 - Decide on the variables and assumptions on the model
3. Step 3 - Gather the data (Questionaire and surveys)
4. Step 4 - Analyze the data
5. Step 5 - Either reject or accept the hypothesis

This is the end of Chapter 1.

Microeconomics looks at specific industries (What we purchase), etc. Macroeconomics looks at broader issues like employment, economic growth, etc. As the name suggests, micro looks like smaller markets and macro looks at bigger issues.

- Gross Domestic Product - The final market value of all goods and values produced within a economy over a certain period. All nations in the UN have to report a GDP. In Canada 2018 was 2.242 trillion (CAD) dollars. The US reported in 2017 was 19.5 trillion USD. The expenditure is equal to the income. The final market value means the final price of the product.

When GDP is measured, four main sectors are analyzed.

1. Consumption by Household - When you go buy appliances, food, services (haircut).
2. Gross Investment by Business/Firms - When companies goes out and buys machinery, construction, and changes in inventories.
3. Government Spending - Gov't spending on final goods, investment goods, and all purchases of resources. Does not include transfer payments, because no production took place.
4. International Spending - We do exports minus imports. This is because imports do not have production happening in the nation.

GDP doesn't measure the distribution of wealth, happiness, pollution, general wisdom. The point that is being put across is that while it measures the general standard of living, it does not measure everything. It does not measure the value of used goods.

In nominal GDP, it doesn't keep track of inflation. In real GDP, we want to take into account inflation to get the "real" GDP. Real GDP uses 2007 prices.

- A deflator is an index that measures the change of prices over time. An example is the consumer price index (CRI). Another GDP deflator is another.

The relationship between real GDP and nominal GDP is:

- Real GDP = Nominal GDP / Deflator \* 100

### Definitions

- Potential GDP - A trend line which GDP converges to
- Inflationary Gap - The actual GDP is greater than the potential GDP
- Expansionary Phase - Where real GDP is rising. It gets to the peak. We knows that economics never continue to peak only. It goes down too, which leads to the up and down cycles. Strikes are signs of recessionary phases (the downward slope). The trough is where unemployment is high, and firms just want to increase their sales.
- Recessionary Gap - The real GDP is less than potential GDP
- A recession is when real GDP is falls for two consecutive quarters. This is the official decision for recession.
- A depression is when real GDP falls for two years or more.

If the economy is at the potential GDP, there is no expansionary phase or recessionary phase.

- Inflation - Over these past couple years, Canada has little inflation (around 2% each year). A inflation is a rise in the general price level. The general price level is measured by the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation is influenced by the general price costs, rather than the price of a specific item.

1. Inflation diminished the purchasing power of the dollar over time. Idea - the dollar can't buy as much as it did before, so it is worth less.
2. Distribution of income effect. Some people who make money on a fixed income (contractors) are disadvantaged. On the contrary, landlords can adjust their prices based on inflation.
3. Can hurt foreign trade.
4. Menu costs - Cost of changing prices. It costs companies money to change their prices (book conferences to deliberate these prices).
5. Bracket Creep - If our salaries are increased due to inflation, we are taxed more so we actually lose money. Taxes tiers always are behind in terms of inflation.

## Lecture 3

Quiz Information:

- Starts 9PM Monday
- Closes 9PM Tuesday
- 20 MC in 30 minutes
- Includes all material up until today
- Open book
- Cannot revisit previously answered question
- Non-stress quiz :)
- Can use calculators

- Cost Push - Inflation as a result as input prices rising (like oil)
- Demand Pull - Upward pressure on prices that follows a shortage in supply.
- Printing of money - Affects cost push and command pull

- Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Measures the price of a typical basket of typical household items. Measured per month (around 600 goods). The value is the rate of change that measures inflation in the company. People who come up with this value visit department stores and checks the prices of these goods. Also includes imports.
  - Typical household items include food, transportation, health, shelter, education, household operations, clothing.
- GDP Deflator - Measures much more household items but does not measure imports.

### Limitations of CPI

- Substitution Bias - Assumes that consumers will not change the things they buy based on the price of the item
- May not represent all consumers. For example, baby diapers is apart of their basket. iPhones and new products are not usually considered.
- Weights of different consumer items in the basket are only changed periodically
- Quality Bias - Does not take into account the improved quality of a product that may cause a increase in price
- Outlet Bias - Many people buy from large discount stores (Costco, Walmart) and the CPI doesn't take this into account. CPI doesn't go to major outlets. They go to like Safeway, etc.

- Core CPI - Take things out of the CPI basket (take out taxes, food, and energy).

CPI = Market Basket Expenditure in Specific Year / Market Basket Expenditure in Base Year \* 100

Real GDP = Nominal / Index \* 100

2007 was chosen as the base year because that year the economy was relatively stable.

- Inflation Rate: (Current Year CPI - Base Year CPI) / Base Year CPI \* 100

- Real Growth Rate: (Current Year Real GDP - Base Year Real GDP) / Base Year Real GDP \* 100. Base Year GDP doesn't necessarily need to be 2007, could just be the first year you want to compare with.

### Unemployment

To get the unemployment rate here in Canada, Labour Stats Canada contacts around 100,000 people in Canada with the survey.

In order for someone to be classified as unemployed, they have to 1. Be not working 2. Actively looking for a job 3. Ready to go back to work immediately.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE = (# of people unemployed) / (labour force) \* 100

LABOUR FORCE = unemployed + employed

- Working Age Population - People 15 years of age and older who are legally entitled to work in Canada
- Not in labour force - Retired people who are not working, people in prison/nursing homes/hospital, full time students, Stay at home parents, discouraged workers. If a retired person is working, they would be classified as employed.

PARTICIPATION RATE = (Labour Force / Working Age Population) \* 100

- Natural Rate of Unemployment - The unemployment rate of a economy in the long run (in Canada, about 6-7%). There will always be able to quit to look for better positions, new graduates who are unemployed for a period of time, etc.

Three Types of Unemployment:

- Frictional Unemployment - Where people are quitting a job to find a better job.
- Seasonal Unemployment - Related to jobs that are only available in certain seasons (ski hill, etc)
- Cyclical Unemployment - Unemployment due to downturn in economy
- Structural Unemployment - Unemployment due to technological change, so they are displaced. Or there is a demise of that industry. Another example is if a gov't enforces a minimum wage that increases unemployment. This is a very problematic type of unemployment.

If we didn't have money, we would need a barter system. A barter system is a trade of goods for goods. Barter system is difficult because you need to find system who needs your exact goods.

Number of possible Prices = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of goods you have. Especially when you have a large number of goods, there's so many different types of trades that can happen.

Money eliminates the issue described above.

### Functions of Money

1. Medium of Exchange

The medium of exchange must be accepted by all parties.

2. Unit of Account

It must have unit, as Canadian dollars has quarters, wages, etc. It must be divisible without the loss of value. If you are charged $20, if you pay two $10 bills then there is no loss of value.

3. Store of Value

It must have some sort of value. Same if you have a computer, it has a store of value. Stocks have a store of value. Money is definitely the most liquid of these assets, where it can be transferred really easy.

All money is subject to Gresham's Law. The idea is that bad money drives out good money. In other words, counterfeit money drives out the usability of good/real money.

- Token Coin - The metal content less more than the face value of the coin. If it was worth more, people will melt the coin.
- Fiat Money - Money with no intrinsic value. For example bills are Fiat Money because its literally just a piece of plastic with no real use other than money.

### Fractional Banks

This is a system where banks only hold a portion of the money deposited with them as reserves (around 4% in Canada). The rest of the money is used for loans.

- The money that is held is in a vault or deposit in the Bank of Canada.
- Gov't makes most of their money from loans.
- Banks are highly profitable.
- They hold deposits and assets.
- They honour cheques.
- They contribute clearing acitivites from the databank. The computerized clearing system is measured by the Canadian Payments Association (CPA). This is important when you transfer your money from one bank to another.

### Money Creation

Assumptions:

- Bank desired reserve ratio is 10%
- The bank lends out all its excess reserves
- A $1000 is deposited into bank A
- Total Reserve = Desired Reserves + Excess Services

Change in Total Deposits = 1 / dr \* Change in Ro

dr = desired reserve ratio
Ro = Initial Reserve

Note: If the person depositing decides to keep some money to spend, thats a cash drain. That decreases the money multiplier. THe money multiplier becomes 1 / (dr + cr), which is the percentage they keep.

## Lecture 4

Reasons for early central banks:

- Didn't want to go to landlords for money, because the landlords always charged too much for borrowing money.
- Seniorage -> Different the price it costs to make a coin versus how much its worth. Government wanted to monopolize this profit.

Bank of Canada was instituted because:

- end of great depression - Basically during the Great Depression, banks started calling in their loans (requesting loans to come back) since they were concerned farmers couldn't pay it back. The farmers indeed couldn't, and gave up their land in the process. This caused a whole bunch of problems.
- end of gold standard - We needed a institution to manage foreign currencies (trading was rising with other countries)
- prevent bank run (bank declaring bankruptcy)

In the beginning, TD bank, BMO, Molsons Bank, each all issue their own currency.

### Bank of Canada

BoC is not a profit oriented organization. Its created to manage economy in efficient way.

The following are goals of the BoC:

- Keep inflation at a stable rate at 1-3%.
- Promote economic growth and employment.
- Protect the value of the Canadian dollar in respect to the other currencies.

Government Bonds - Government issues a bond of X$ and promise to pay interest when it matures. The government uses this way to generate money.

Main Responsibilities:

- Funds Management - BoC manages the government money and all their bonds.
- Monetary Policy - Contracts or expands money supply in Canada
- Financial System - Oversees the settlement system between the major charter banks.
- Currency - Designing currency. Creating new ones and destroying old ones.
- Research - Look at inflation in various parts of Canada, look at regional disparities, etc.

Settlement between major charter banks:

- If a charter bank (TD bank) doesn't have enough money at the end of a day to send money to a different bank for its customer transactions, it has two options:
  - Borrow money from the Bank of Canada while paying a interest rate
  - Borrow money from a different bank that has a surplus at the end of day. This usually has lower interest rates.

OPERATING BAND - Range of interest rates. Top is the bank rate. Lower end is the interest rate paid on deposits. The bank rate is the highest, which is what you pay for Bank of Canada. The lower end is for when you're paying a separate bank. These are set each year.

The Bank of Canada also manages gold and silver.

EXPANSIONARY MONETARY POLICY - Increase money supply. To organize this, BoC contacts all the major charter banks and tell them that that BoC buy securities from the major charter banks.
CONTRACTION MONETARY POLICY - The BoC will sell securities to the banks at a discount. The discount is what motivates the banks to give away their money.

- Standing Liquity Facility - BoC made one-day loans to the banks initially. After the financial crisis, the BoC agreed to do it for longer. This was about for 6 months (grace period for loans).

### Park Text Chapter 3 (Project Evaluation)

A dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future. This is because you can put that dollar into investment.

Power of compounding - On money you earn interest, you earn interest on that interest. So it compounds.

Simple Interest - Interest is earned on the principle amount.

Fv = P(1 + years \* interest rate)

Fv = Future Value
P = Principle amount

Compond Interest - You earn interest on interest.

Fv = P(1 + interest rate)^years

Factor Notation = F = P(F/P, i, N)
i = interest rate
N = years
F/P = Future depending on present

ECONOMIC EQUIVALENCE - The Present Value compared to the Future Value (based on the interest rate). For example, the $1000 you get today or the $1100 you get a year from now, assuming a constant 10% interest rate.

FUTURE VALUE OF ANNUITY - If you put in money every year or at certain intervals.

Fv = A[((1 + i)^n - 1) / i]
Fv = A(F/A, i, N)

A = Value you put in annually

Example:
F = 1000((1.1)^5 - 1 / 0.1)

If we put in $1000 each year, with 10% each year, and we need the value after 5 years.

## Lecture 5

The midterm will cover up until mortgages. Normally the midterm is 60 minutes, but with the extra time allocation, we'll have 90 minutes. The MC section will likely cover the Bank of Canada, money multiplier, monetary policy, etc. We have a 24-hour window for the quiz.

The midterm can be downloaded and will be uploaded. There will be no lecture on Wednesday. We will have formula sheets in our exams.

Sinking Fund Formula = A = Fv(i/(1+i)^n - 1) - Looks like we're just rearranging the equation? The idea here is that we have the future value, and we want to know how much we want to put in.

Present Value of Annuity - The money you essentially have today if you were to withdraw at a interest rate every year. Formula is down here:

PV = A((1 - (1+i)^-N) / i)

Capital Recovery Formula - If we were to rearrange the Present Value of Annuity. Rearrange for A:

A = PV((i(i+i)^N)/((1+i)^(N)-1))

### Linear Gradient

Imagine we invest in a way where we linearly increase the amount of invest each year. Imagine we invest $1000 in year 1, $1100 in year 2, $1200 in year 3, etc.

Fv = G/i (((1+i)^N - 1 / i) - N)

G = gradient
i = interest
N = years

F = G(F/G, i, N)

The gradient is essentially the $ value you add on each year.

PRESENT VALUE OF A LINEAR GRADIENT:

Pv = G(((1+i)^n - iN - 1) / (i^2 (1+i)^N))
P = G(P/G, i, N)

Another example where we would have a geometric gradient. Instead of going up by a linear gradient, a geometric gradient would go up by the percentage each year.

### If the interest is compounded more than once per year

Effective Annual Interest Rate

Effective Annual Rate = (1 + r/m)^m - 1

r = Nominal Interest Rate / YR
m = Number of compounding periods per year

Hence we can compute the effective interest rate per year to perform other types of computations.

### Types of Problems in the Real World

1. Interest componding periods + payment periods occur at the same time
2. Interest componding periods + payment periods do not occur at the same time

When approaching these problems, i per the interval is the yearly / N per year. N is the total intervals over time.

## Lecture 6

Midterm is Wednesday. On the day, we go on the D2L dropbox. Open the Academic Integrity form and sign and upload it. Then we can start the test, its a two part procedure.

Part A is 15 questions. Part B is problem solving questions.

Content:

- Chapters 5 (Unemployment)
- Chapters 10 (Banking Bank of Canada)
- Chapter 3 (Time Value of money)
- Chapter 4 (up to mortgages)

Open Book means only using class content. No communicating with other classmates and using the internet.

If we have technical problems and cannot upload it, we can go ahead and email it to them.

### General or Complex Annuities

Interset compounding periods and payment periods do not occur at the same time.

Therefore the equation for the effective rate per payment period is:

i = (1 + r/m)^c - 1

r = Nominal or stated annual rate
m = # of compounding periods per year
c = # of compounding periods per payment period

Terminology:

1. Term - The amount of time a mortgage rate is guaranteed
2. Amortization - The time in which you have to pay the mortgage

Conventional Mortgage - 80% of selling price or appraised value - whichever is lower
Non-Conventional Mortgage - If you want to mortgage more than 80%, you need mortgage insurance. This can be very expensive. This doesn't protect the buyer, but the seller.

Closed Mortgage - There is a penalty if you pay off mortgage earlier than term.
Open Mortgage - No penalty if you pay off mortgage earlier than term.
Portability - Allows you to transfer existing mortgaged house to another house (i.e. if you want to upgrade the house).

_End of Midterm Content_

### Bonds

If a government or company issues a bond, they say that "we'll pay you interest every interval, and at the end we'll pay you your original amount of money back".

There's no guarantee that a bond original amount will be paid back (the company can go bankrupt). But that's why you should research about the reliability of the company. The government has never bailed on a bond.

For example:

The government issues a $100,000 bond at 5%. We buy it. The bond length/maturity is 20 years from when its issued. 

This means that I get $5000 every year I keep the bond, and $100,000 at the end of the length. Usually 5% is a bit high.

However, let's suppose that we expect the interests to go down in a couple years. i.e. the interest rate goes from 5% to 3%. We can choose to sell our owned bond in five years for greater than $100,000, because 5% interest rate is higher than normal now.

There's a inverse relationship between interest rate and bonds.

Definitions for Bonds:
- Coupon Rate: Interest Rate on the bond. Almost always paid semi-annually.
- Redemption Date: Maturity Date, the date that the principal is paid
- Redemption Value - i) Redeemable at par ii) Redeemable at premium (i.e. $100,000 at 104). Basically if you held it till the end, you get the 4% extra
- Yield to Maturity - The rate of return that takes into account the difference between the par value and the market value if they are different
- Current Yield - Annual interest rate earned as a % of the current price.

- Net Present Value - When you buy a equipment, you will have net cash flows (incoming cash flow - annual maintenance costs). The net present value is the infront cost + cash flows - maintenance cost. This is used to determine whether this investment is worth it.

How do we compute Net Present Value (NPV)?
- NPV = A + PV of net cash flows

A = Original cost

Thus,
NPV = A + sum of (net cash flow / (1+i)^n)

n = years
i = Marr (Minimum acceptable rate of return). Usually determined by the client.

### Decision Rule
If the NPV for a project is greater than 0, accept the project.
If the NPV for a project is less than 0, reject the project.
If the NPV for a project is equal to 0, we may accept or reject the project.

## Lecture 7

Net Present Value:
- NPV = A + PV of net cash flows

A is the initial investment
PV is the cash flow (money you're technically earning yearly)

MARR = Minimum Rate of return required by client

The NPV is the amount that our net worth of our firm that will be increased. Basically if the NPV is 30k, that means that the net worth of the company will be increased by 30k.

What if we want to evaluate the project in the future instead of the current time? There is a different equation for that.

NFV = A + FV of net cash flows

The NFV and the NPV are economically equivalent.

Payback Period - PBP is the amount of time (yrs) for an initial investment to be recovered (neglecting the time value of money).

If you have even cash flows:
PBP = Initial cash flow / Yearly cash flow

If you have uneven cash flows:
Calculations are a bit different.
To compute this, we can calculate the cumulative cash flows each year and see which year in which we will recover our initial cash flow. We use a slope equation to figure out how long it takes to get to a certain value using the two upper and lower bound values.

Problems with PBP:
1. It does not take into any future cash flows beyond payback period.
2. Cost of financial capital.
3. No allowance for salvage values or reclamation cost at end of project.
4. If the signs of cash flows change frequently, it does not make sense to use PBP as the main decision tool.

Discounted Pay-Back Period:
Take into consideration of the time value of money. Basically just take the cash flow each year, and find the current day value of the dollar value with the interest rate.

The third decision tool to make decisions is the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

The IRR is the interest rate that makes the net present value equal to 0.

The fourth decision tool is known as the annual equivalent analysis.

Benefit:
1. Many reports summarize or use yearly revenues + costs.
2. Need for unit costs.
3. Useful when evaluating projects with different service lives.

Difference between capital vs operating costs.
1. Capital costs are "one time" costs, such as equipment, factories, furnace, buildings.
2. Operating Cost: Annual operating costs (labour, fuel, maintenance)

Comparing mutually exclusive alternatives:
1. Service Project - These are projects in which the revenue do not depend on the choice of the project. In the situation, we want to select the alternative with the least cost. That would include, a new machine, delivery trucky, or computerized system that would reduce utility usage.
2. Revenue Projects - These are where revenues change as a result of the project. Our decision then is to select the project with the largest net gain to the firm. For example, a new manufacturing facility, a new system, or a new product line.
